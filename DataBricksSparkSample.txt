 # Step 1: Create a Spark session (if not already created)
# This is typically handled by Databricks automatically

# Step 2: Create a DataFrame from sample data
data = [
    ("John", 25, "New York"),
    ("Anna", 28, "San Francisco"),
    ("Mike", 26, "Chicago"),
    ("Sarah", 22, "Seattle")
]

columns = ["Name", "Age", "City"]

df = spark.createDataFrame(data, columns)
df.show()

# Step 3: Register the DataFrame as a temporary view
df.createOrReplaceTempView("people")

# Step 4: Run SQL queries

# Query 1: Select all data
result = spark.sql("SELECT * FROM people")
result.show()

# Query 2: Filter data by age
result = spark.sql("SELECT Name, Age FROM people WHERE Age > 25")
result.show()

# Query 3: Count people by city
result = spark.sql("SELECT City, COUNT(*) as count FROM people GROUP BY City")
result.show()
